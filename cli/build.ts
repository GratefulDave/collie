// `build` and the lazy `ensure_build`, ported from the pre-shim `collie-ctl.sh`. The six ordered
// steps and their reasons come along with the code, because every one of them is a production
// incident someone already paid for:
//
//   1. version gate     — a release whose four version files disagree must not go live.
//   2. install BOTH     — the root typecheck resolves @types/bun from the ROOT node_modules; a fresh
//      trees              Herdr checkout ships neither tree, so without the root install the very
//                         first build dies with TS2688 and Herdr rolls the install back (issue #9).
//   3. lint the tree    — one `.oxlintrc.json`, shared by every enforcement surface; the full-tree
//                         run is the authoritative one, and it is the cheapest step that can fail.
//   4. typecheck BOTH   — the Vite build does not typecheck, so a type error would ship silently.
//      sides
//   5. compile the CLI  — `bin/collie` is a build product, so an `update` that changed cli/ produces
//                         a binary matching the checkout it was built from.
//   6. build the web    — into `web/dist-staging`, never into `web/dist`: Vite empties its output
//      bundle             dir first, and the bridge serves `web/dist` FROM DISK at request time, so
//                         building in place would leave the served directory empty with no rollback.
//
// The swaps are LAST, after every step that can fail, and each is a same-filesystem rename. That is
// the invariant this module exists for: a build that fails leaves the previously served bundle
// byte-identical and the running binary untouched.
