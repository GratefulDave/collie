// `collie hooks install claude` / `uninstall claude` / `status` — putting the beacon emitter into the
// agent's own settings, and taking it back out.
//
// ── THE SCOPE IS GLOBAL, AND THAT IS THE MILESTONE'S PREMISE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The targets are `~/.claude/settings.json` and the same file in every `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` profile
// the journal registry already knows about (issue #92). PROJECT SETTINGS ARE NEVER WRITTEN — not
// `.claude/settings.json`, not `.claude/settings.local.json`. The operator adopts panes *anywhere on
// the host*, so a per-project install would make a pane's identity depend on which directory the
// agent happened to be started in, which is precisely the fragility beacons exist to remove. The cost
// of the global scope is one process spawn per hook event outside a multiplexer, and `beacon emit`'s
// environment gate makes that cost nothing.
//
// ── THREE GUARDS, EACH EARNED FROM A REAL FAILURE (Ark0N/Codeman) ─────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. MERGE BY A VERSION-PREFIXED OWNERSHIP MARKER. Claude Code merges hook entries across settings
//     levels rather than replacing them, so an operator's own hooks sit in the same arrays as ours.
//     Every entry we write carries {@link HOOK_MARKER}; an entry without one is never touched, read
//     or reordered, and `uninstall` removes only marked entries. A marker at a DIFFERENT version is
//     replaced in place — that is the self-heal, and it is why the version is in the marker at all.
//  2. REFUSE A SYMLINKED TARGET. Writing through a symlink is how an installer edits a file the
//     operator did not mean.
//  3. WRITE ATOMICALLY, AND BACK UP ONCE. Temp file plus rename, and a `.collie-backup` beside the
//     file before the first modification, so a bad merge is one `mv` from undone.
//
// Installing twice changes no bytes: the second run serialises the same document and writes nothing.
