// ── WHAT LIVES HERE AND WHAT DOES NOT ────────────────────────────────────────
// Nothing in this file decides what a trust store should contain. Every mutation is one of the pure
// transitions in `bridge/pack/enrollment.ts`, committed through `commitPackChange`, so the engine's
// exhaustive failure matrix tests the production path and this module is left holding argument
// parsing, ordering, and the words an operator reads. Where a verb needs the far side, it goes
// through `PeerClient` over an injected `fetch` — never a bare one, and never a second dial path that
// could forget the `Authorization` header (PACK_PROTOCOL.md §6).
//
// ── SECRETS NEVER TOUCH ARGV (§8.3) ──────────────────────────────────────────
// `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is mode 444 and `ps -eo args` is world-readable — the concrete leak ADR 0001
// records. So the ONLY credential any verb accepts on a command line is the enrollment token, which is
// single-use and lives ten minutes, and even that prefers `-` (stdin) or `@<path>` (a 0600 file); the
// literal form warns on stderr. The pack secret is never an argument, never printed and never
// interpolated into a message: it moves from the 0600 trust store, into memory, onto an admitted link.
//
// ── EVERY MUTATION RESTARTS THE SERVICE, ON PURPOSE ──────────────────────────
// `TrustStore` reads its file once per process (bridge/pack/trust-store.ts) and the running bridge
// resolves its mode, its push gate and its peer roster at construction. A verb that only rewrote the
// file would leave a peer still publishing, still pushing and still solo until something else
// happened to restart it. So the verbs that change membership restart the local service through the
// injected `restart`, and say so in their output.

 * Then, for a `front-door` address only, `COLLIE_PUBLIC_URL`. Otherwise it is this node's Tailscale
 * name, which is what `collie url` already prints. There is no further guess: an address we cannot
 * state is an error the operator fixes with a flag, not a `localhost` the far side would dial forever.
 *
 * **`COLLIE_PUBLIC_URL` is the front door's configured truth, and it is consulted here (amended
 * 2026-08-13).** It used to feed only the QR and the status banner, on the reasoning that a
 * Variant-C/E operator's lever was `--address`. The field says otherwise: a lead behind a reverse
 * proxy derives its tailnet name here, and a one-way tailnet ACL makes that name perfectly correct
 * and silently undialable *from the peer* — `collie join` hangs, and nothing names the cause. The
 * remedy was a flag the operator had to remember on every `pack invite`/`pack add`, and forgot four
 * times in five. Which ingress a machine actually publishes is per-INSTALLATION truth, so it belongs
 * in config, next to the URL the phone already opens. Only the ORIGIN is used (scheme + host + port):
 * the pack link mounts at `/pack/v1/*` off the origin, so a path is dropped with a warning, and a
 * value that does not parse as a URL warns and falls through to the derivation rather than aborting
 * the verb — a malformed banner variable must not be able to break enrollment.
 *
 * **The `pack-listener` kind never consults it**, and that is not an oversight: a peer is dialled on
 * its own listener (`COLLIE_HOST:COLLIE_PORT`) and publishes no front door at all (§3, ADR 0013). A
 * public URL is a front door by definition, so pointing a lead at one for the listener kind would
 * aim it at whatever answers that proxy — never this peer's `/pack/v1/*`. The QR and the status
 * banner are unchanged; this adds a reader, it moves nothing.
 *
 * **A derived `pack-listener` address always carries an explicit port, and that is the whole reason
 * `kind` exists.** A bare host dials :443 (`packUrl`/`enrollUrl` assume `https://`) — which is right
 * for a lead, whose pack surface rides the front door, and silently wrong for a peer, whose listener
 * is `COLLIE_PORT` and nothing else. Left portless, a hand-typed `collie join` on a default-configured
 * machine hands the lead an address it will dial forever at a port nothing listens on, and the member
 * simply stays provisional with no line naming the cause. So the peer direction appends this
 * instance's own port — the same `COLLIE_PORT`/default the bridge binds — and the front-door direction
 * keeps 443 implicit, because that is the port it is actually published on.
 *
 * Nothing here rewrites an address already stored on either side: a record minted before this
 * distinction is repaired by `collie reconnect`, which is the verb for exactly that.
