// `collie doctor` — one read-only pass over the traps that fail silently (M7/02).
//
// ── READ-ONLY IS THE CONTRACT, NOT A GUIDELINE ───────────────────────────────
// Nothing here writes a file, touches a service, mutates a store or publishes/tears down a front
// door. That is what makes `doctor` safe to run on a machine that is already misbehaving — a
// diagnostic that "helpfully" fixes something has changed the evidence before you read it. It is
// enforced structurally rather than by care: {@link DoctorDeps} names no lifecycle verb, no audit
// log and no mutating store method, so there is nothing to call.
//
// ── IT REUSES `pack status`'s PROBES ─────────────────────────────────────────
// `deriveMode`, `bindIsWildcard`, `probeMembers`, `parseMarker`/`rosterDrift` (the two pure halves
// `reportDrift` itself prints from), `tailnetInboundBlocked`, and `serve.ts`'s ownership parsing are
// all imported, never re-derived. A second implementation of a probe is a second thing to drift, and
// a doctor that disagrees with `pack status` is worse than no doctor.
//
// ── EVERY FINDING NAMES A VERB ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Each check is one line with a status and, unless it passed, the remedy. "Something is wrong"
// without a verb is not a finding — the whole value of this verb is that each of these traps
// currently announces itself as something else (a loopback bind reads as "the lead can't reach the
// peer", a deny-all ACL as "server down", clock skew as a 401, a rebuilt-not-restarted bridge as "my
// change didn't take").
