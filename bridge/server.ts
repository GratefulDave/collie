 *    under COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http (no TLS). Empty COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS keeps the legacy behaviour so
 *    existing deployments don't break (see the startup warning).
 *  - Same-origin only (Origin host must equal Host) — defeats cross-site requests/CSRF. Browsers
 *    omit Origin on same-origin GETs (so the snapshot poll passes); they send it on POSTs.
 *    localhost and explicitly-configured origins are also allowed.
 *  - Origin required for writes: a state-changing (`level === "write"`) request with no Origin is
 *    trusted only from loopback (curl on the host). Browsers always send Origin on fetch/SW POSTs,
 *    so a missing Origin on a remote write is a non-browser or Origin-stripped request — reject it.
 *  - Tailscale identity: when a trusted user is configured, every API request must carry the

 *                                          through that proxy and must not drive a terminal.
 *   - header present, value allowlisted  → authorised; the session is attributed to that device.
 *   - header present, value not listed   → read-only. The "unknown" sentinel is never authorised,
 *                                          and an empty allowlist makes every device read-only — a

 *
 * "Read-only" is the whole scope of this gate, deliberately: {@link guard} consults it only for
 * `"write"`, so a header-less caller still reads panes. That is the existing design (a read-only
 * device is meant to watch), and this function does not change it. What changes is that a missing
 * header no longer counts as the operator.
 *
 * The absent-header case deliberately has no loopback exemption. It looks like the natural place for
 * one, but every supported front door is a proxy co-located with the bridge (tailscale serve and the
 * documented reverse proxies all connect to 127.0.0.1), so a loopback peer says nothing about
 * whether the caller is the operator on the host or a remote client whose proxy failed to inject the
 * header. Driving a pane from the host is still one flag away: send an allowlisted id yourself.
