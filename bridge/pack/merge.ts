// The ONE place the lead re-serialises (PACK_PROTOCOL.md §9.2). Everything else a pack link carries
// is proxied byte-for-byte; this file folds N peers' snapshots plus the lead's own into the single
// body `/api/snapshot` answers.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE IS PURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It takes a local body, a list of peer contributions and a clock reading, and returns a body. No
// fetch, no timer, no `Bun.serve`, no registry. That is what lets merge.test.ts exercise the three
// states of §10.2 (reachable / unreachable / incompatible) as data rather than as a network, and it
// is the CLAUDE.md testability rule applied to the most consequential function in the pack.
//
// ── THE THREE INVARIANTS IT EXISTS TO HOLD ───────────────────────────────────
//  1. UNREACHABLE IS A VALUE, NEVER AN ERROR (§10.2). Nothing here throws or omits a member. A peer
//     that is down, slow, skewed or refusing becomes a `reachable:false` row with zeroed-nothing —
//     its sessions and panes are still listed, from the last-good body.
//  2. A PEER'S SESSIONS NEVER VANISH (§10.2). The lead renders the last-good snapshot and marks it
//     stale from `lastSeenAt`; a triage list that flickers is worse than one that is honestly stale.
//     Concretely: {@link mergeSnapshot} reads `contribution.body`, which the sweep only ever
//     REPLACES on success and never clears on failure.
//  3. FRESHNESS IS THE LEAD'S RECEIPT TIME (§10.2). `lastSeenAt` comes from `PeerState`, which
//     `PeerClient` stamps from the lead's own clock on every branch. A peer's clock is never read —
//     nothing in this file touches a timestamp that arrived over the wire, and `parsePeerSnapshot`
//     drops the peer's own `ts` on the floor for exactly that reason.
//
// ── AND THE ONE IT HOLDS FOR SOLO ────────────────────────────────────────────
// A solo instance never calls this function. `servers` is optional-and-absent (§11) and the host tag
// is added HERE, not upstream, so with no pack the body that leaves server.ts is the object literal
// it has always been — same keys, same order, same bytes, same ETag.
