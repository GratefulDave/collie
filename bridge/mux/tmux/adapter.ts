// TMUX, BEHIND THE CONTRACT — the second adapter, and the first written against a contract nobody
// had implemented yet (M10/04).
//
// Everything above this file talks the mux port (../types.ts); everything below it — exec.ts,
// protocol.ts, keys.ts, watch.ts — talks tmux. So this module is the whole translation, exactly as
// `herdr/adapter.ts` is for Herdr, and it is the only file holding both vocabularies at once.
//
// ── THE MAPPING, WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE IT WILL BE RE-PROPOSED ─────────────────────────────────────
//
//   tmux session  →  Collie SPACE   (`$0`)
//   tmux window   →  Collie TAB     (`@3`)
//   tmux pane     →  Collie PANE    (`%7`)
//
// It is the natural one and it is also the only one that survives identity rule 2. The tempting
// alternative — one space per tmux SERVER, tabs from sessions — collapses two levels into one and
// leaves nothing to map windows onto; the other — ignore sessions and treat every window as a space
// — throws away the grouping the operator actually organises by. tmux's three levels are Collie's
// three levels, and each id is carried through UNCHANGED: `$N`, `@N`, `%N` are tmux's own,
// server-lifetime unique, never recycled, and stable across a rename (a session_id survives what a
// session_name does not). `%` is legal in a Collie id for precisely this reason (../identity.ts).
//
// ── WHAT TMUX DOES NOT KNOW, SAID OUT LOUD ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// tmux has **no idea what an agent is**. It reports `pane_current_command` and `pane_title`, and
// neither is an answer: `pane_current_command` is whatever is in the foreground this second (the
// probe caught it reading `tmux` for a pane that had just run a tmux command), and a wrong agent name
// picks a wrong harness grammar AND a wrong journal adapter. So `agentDetection` is declared absent
// and every pane reports `"shell"` / `"unknown"` — the contract's documented answer, and NOT a guess
// (../types.ts § MuxPane.agent). `agentSessionRef` follows: with no agent, there is no session an
// agent named, so pane history is declared ABSENT rather than served empty (M10/06 renders that).
//
// ── ONE TITLE SLOT, AND WHO GETS IT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// tmux has exactly one per-pane label — `pane_title` — where the contract has two (`paneLabel`, the
// operator's, and `terminalTitle`, the program's). Collie spends it on the OPERATOR: `renamePane`
// writes it and it comes back as `paneLabel`. `terminalTitle` is therefore never reported on tmux;
// reporting the same string twice under two names would tell the UI that a program said something it
// did not. tmux's own default for the slot is the host name, which is why {@link operatorLabel}
// drops a title equal to it — an untouched pane has no label, and saying "bluefin" would be noise.

 *    below, which `declareCapabilities` turns into an explicit `false`), for the reason in the header.
 *    Declaring either would make the herd view invent agents out of process names. The ONE thing
 *    that can lift them is the beacon decorator, which needs the agent's own hooks and is not this
 *    adapter (M11/03) — this declaration stays `false` under it, unchanged.
 *
 * Everything else is claimed because a probe ran it on tmux 3.6b: `capture-pane -p -e` returned SGR
 * and nothing else, `-S -N` reached 51 lines behind a 24-line viewport, `send-keys` typed and
 * chorded, `select-pane -T` set and cleared a label, `kill-pane` / `kill-window` / `new-window -P` /
